# Cyber Security Internship Task 1: Network Port Scanning

## What I Did

- Used **Kali Linux** as the primary environment to perform network scanning, since it is widely used for cybersecurity tasks.
- Installed and ran **Nmap** on Kali Linux to scan my local network's IP range (`192.168.0.0/24`) using TCP SYN scan (`nmap -sS 192.168.0.0/24`).
- Collected scan results and analysed open ports and running services.
- As an alternative, performed the same scan on **Windows** machine using Nmap to compare results and experience.
- Saved scan outputs as text files and documented findings.

## Outcome

- Gained hands-on experience using Nmap on both Kali Linux and Windows platforms.
- Understood network exposure through open ports in a local network environment.
- Learned differences in usage and environment setup between Kali Linux and Windows.
- Prepared detailed documentation and uploaded all files to GitHub for submission.
